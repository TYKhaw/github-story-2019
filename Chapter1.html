                A bright light shone through my little eyes as I slowly open them, all while self-narrating to myself, “Guess I survived yet another day”. Trying to believe that everything is alright, I start to stand up on all four and in search for food and new shelter for tonight. As you might have guessed it or maybe not, I am a dog now astray after my previous owner went missing.

                Thinking back, it’s been three days since I have seen my master, I was being thrown out of the house by some people I have never seen before who came in to our home abruptly. My master was always kind to me and to others, he brings me to the outside world often, and that’s where I see my kind master lends out a warm helping hand to whomever is in need of help. This is a huge contrast to what he looks like in life, where he stands 6 feet tall and very well built.

                A sudden sound of a dropping can was heard down the alley as it broke me from thinking back the past, I turn my head towards the noise and see a humanly figure running from a few other human. The figure who was running away had me pondering as I have a feeling it looks a lot like my previous owner and thus, I gave chase too.
