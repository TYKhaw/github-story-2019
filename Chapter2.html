				Giving my all to chasing them, I eventually end up to the other end of the alley. I saw the person who was being chased started chanting some sort of incantation and opened a portal which he jumps into it without hesitation. His portal closes as soon as he steps into it but the gang does not plan on giving up and also opens a portal which I assume is going to where he is going. Immediately after they went into it, I rush into the portal at the very last second.
			</p>
			<p>
				On the other end of the portal, what I saw amazed me, a large green grass plain with patches of flowers everywhere. It looks almost the same as what it is back in my homeland when in spring as I was briefly stunned by this magnificent scene. When my wandering soul decided to come back into my body, I totally lost all of them that I was previously chasing. Without a way to go back, I decided to look around and see what I can find otherwise helpful for either track those people or my way back.
			</p>

				All while walking in this beautiful plain, I manage to stumble across a well-hidden man-made hole. Interested with it, I carefully walk into the hole, which is almost the size of a crawling adult human, but since I am a dog, I have no problem going into it. It was dark inside, however, not that far into the hole I see light and following the light brings me into a well-built underground bunker, or should I say home, since it feels more welcoming than having nothing in it. It just looks like an ordinary home without second thought, with the only exception that it is being build underground, but more to that is that it looks exactly like the house I used to live with my master.
			</p>
			<p>
				As I move closer to inspect the house, a figure suddenly appeared from behind.
