				The figure’s hand pats my head gently and to my awe, it was my master that I was chasing all along. After a brief moment of explanation, I kind of understand what the whole story is all about. Apparently, my master is someone from the future and through a time portal machine he wears, he is able to traverse between timelines. It was illegal to be used in the future as the government thought it might cause more issues to not just the present but also the past and future. Tired of the life in the future where different countries with different agenda fighting against each other, he chose to live a simple life in my time, thus adopting me from the pet rescue.
			</p>
			<p>
				Somehow, his location in the time space fabric is being found by the Space-Time Police (STP), and therefore of him missing for quite some time without leaving any traces behind. He felt sorry for leaving me unattended during the period and was shocked yet grateful to see me here now. He then went to get some food and water for me as I sit down obediently.
			</p>
			<p>
				But it is also at this time, we heard rustling and noises coming from the outside of the hole. It feels like some of the police managed to track to this location and wants to search for any clues of my master. Without second thought, my master carried me up and rush to a cupboard. With a click here and a tap there, a secret passage opens and we again are on the run.
			</p>
			<p>
				Running desperately, my master is waiting for the machine to charge up so that we could move through time space to get loose from the chase. Looking back the police seems to have easily found the passage and is closing up onto us. But in the very nick of time, the machine works and both of us starts our journey throughout the time line while running away from the STP.
			</p>
			<p>
				To be continued…
